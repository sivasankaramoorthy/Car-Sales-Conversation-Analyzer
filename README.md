# Car-Sales-Conversation-Analyzer
Car Sales Conversation Analyzer
This project is a Streamlit web application designed to analyze car sales conversations between customers and salespersons. The application extracts relevant customer requirements, discussed company policies, and customer objections, and provides sentiment analysis on the conversations. The application uses the LLaMA 2 model for natural language processing and is integrated with Hugging Face for model management.

Features
Extract Customer Requirements: 
                  Identify the car brand, type, fuel type, color, distance traveled, make year, and transmission type from conversation transcripts.
Company Policies Extraction:
                  Detect discussions about company policies such as free RC transfer, money-back guarantees, free RSA, and return policies.
Customer Objections Identification: 
                  Recognize customer objections related to refurbishment quality, car issues, pricing, and customer experience.
Sentiment Analysis: 
                  Analyze the sentiment of the conversation (positive, negative, or neutral) using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
Visualization:
                  Provides bar charts summarizing extracted information like car types, colors, and objections.
Support for Multiple File Types: 
                  Upload and process conversation transcripts in both text and PDF formats.
Downloadable JSON: 
                  Extracted information can be downloaded as JSON files.
